- 👋 Hi, I’m @code4fun206
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a front end developer and maybe full stack developer after landing my first job.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and I've already learned the basics of CSS/HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to help me develop my front end skills and I am willing to give back as much as I can.
- 📫 How to reach me through email: kennethcasey88@gmail.com
